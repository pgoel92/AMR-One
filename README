evaluate_jamr_isi.py : Evaluation script for JAMR alignments with ISI alignments
my_amr_parser.py : Parses the AMR and stores it in a tree. Supports node retrieval by address.
mod_out.py : Used to generate corp_span from JAMR outputs corp and span
run.sh : Runs JAMR on the dev and test data that was used by ISI for their alignments
accuracy : Final precision, recall measures over the combined dev and test datasets

manual_testing/ : contains sampled data from the dev and test sets to verify manually if my evaluation was correct

Summary :

I fixed the evaluation error. I had to write a function that converts an ISI address to a JAMR address in cases where there are re-entrancies. The new precision recall numbers are : 

Dev Precision : 93.26
Dev Recall : 39.85
Test Precision : 92.67
Test Recall : 39.30

I also calculated the number of FPs caused due to the ordering problem.

Dev : 31/46
Test : 21/34
