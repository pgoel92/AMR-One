# ::snt A form of asbestos once used to make Kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than 30 years ago , researchers reported .
# ::snt The asbestos fiber , crocidolite , is unusually resilient once it enters the lungs , with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later , researchers said .
# ::snt Lorillard Inc. , the unit of New York - based Loews Corp. that makes Kent cigarettes , stopped using crocidolite in its Micronite cigarette filters in 1956 .
# ::snt Although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago , the latest results appear in today 's New England Journal of Medicine , a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem .
# ::snt A Lorillard spokewoman said , `` This is an old story .
# ::snt We 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties .
# ::snt There is no asbestos in our products now . ''
# ::snt `` We have no useful information on whether users are at risk , '' said James A. Talcott of Boston 's Dana - Farber Cancer Institute .
# ::snt Dr. Talcott led a team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute and the medical schools of Harvard University and Boston University .
# ::snt The Lorillard spokeswoman said asbestos was used in `` very modest amounts '' in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of filter in 1956 .
# ::snt From 1953 to 1955 , 9.8 billion Kent cigarettes with the filters were sold , the company said .
# ::snt Among 33 men who worked closely with the substance , 28 have died -- more than three times the expected number .
# ::snt Four of the five surviving workers have asbestos - related diseases , including three with recently diagnosed cancer .
# ::snt The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma , lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than expected , the researchers said .
# ::snt `` The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who study asbestos - related diseases , '' said Dr. Talcott .
# ::snt The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the West Groton , Mass. , paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in Western industrialized countries , he said .
# ::snt The plant , which is owned by Hollingsworth & Vose Co. , was under contract with Lorillard to make the cigarette filters .
# ::snt The finding probably will support those who argue that the U.S. should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos , chrysotile , found in most schools and other buildings , Dr. Talcott said .
# ::snt The U.S. is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth , needle - like fibers such as crocidolite that are classified as amphobiles , according to Brooke T. Mossman , a professor of pathlogy at the University of Vermont College of Medicine .
# ::snt More common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the body , Dr. Mossman explained .
# ::snt In July , the Environmental Protection Agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos .
# ::snt By 1997 , almost all remaining uses of cancer - causing asbestos will be outlawed .
# ::snt About 160 workers at a factory that made paper for the Kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s .
# ::snt Areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used .
# ::snt Workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin , poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters .
# ::snt Workers described `` clouds of blue dust '' that hung over parts of the factory , even though exhaust fans ventilated the area .
# ::snt `` There 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos - related diseases , '' said Darrell Phillips , vice president of human resources for Hollingsworth & Vose .
# ::snt It has no bearing on our work force today .
# ::snt Yields on money - market mutual funds continued to slide , amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates .
# ::snt The average seven - day compound yield of the 400 taxable funds tracked by IBC 's Money Fund Report eased a fraction of a percentage point to 8.45 % from 8.47 % for the week ended Tuesday .
# ::snt Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year .
# ::snt Average maturity of the funds ' investments lengthened by a day to 41 days , the longest since early August , according to Donoghue 's .
# ::snt Longer maturities are thought to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period .
# ::snt Shorter maturities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner .
# ::snt The average maturity for funds open only to institutions , considered by some to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely , reached a high point for the year -- 33 days .
# ::snt Nevertheless , said Brenda Malizia Negus , editor of Money Fund Report , yields `` may blip up again before they blip down '' because of recent rises in short - term interest rates .
# ::snt The yield on six - month Treasury bills sold at Monday 's auction , for example , rose to 8.04 % from 7.90 % .
# ::snt Despite recent declines in yields , investors continue to pour cash into money funds .
# ::snt Assets of the 400 taxable funds grew by $ 1.5 billion during the latest week , to $ 352.7 billion .
# ::snt Typically , money - fund yields beat comparable short - term investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates .
# ::snt The top money funds are currently yielding well over 9 % .
# ::snt Dreyfus World - Wide Dollar , the top - yielding fund , had a seven - day compound yield of 9.37 % during the latest week , down from 9.45 % a week earlier .
# ::snt It invests heavily in dollar - denominated securities overseas and is currently waiving management fees , which boosts its yield .
# ::snt The average seven - day simple yield of the 400 funds was 8.12 % , down from 8.14 % .
# ::snt The 30 - day simple yield fell to an average 8.19 % from 8.22 % ; the 30 - day compound yield slid to an average 8.53 % from 8.56 % .
# ::snt J.P. Bolduc , vice chairman of W.R. Grace & Co. , which holds a 83.4 % interest in this energy - services company , was elected a director .
# ::snt He succeeds Terrence D. Daniels , formerly a W.R. Grace vice chairman , who resigned .
# ::snt W.R. Grace holds three of Grace Energy 's seven board seats .
# ::snt McDermott International Inc. said its Babcock & Wilcox unit completed the sale of its Bailey Controls Operations to Finmeccanica S.p . A. for $ 295 million .

# ::snt Legislation to lift the debt ceiling is ensnarled in the fight over cutting capital - gains taxes .
# ::snt The House has voted to raise the ceiling to $ 3.1 trillion , but the Senate is n't expected to act until next week at the earliest .
# ::snt The Treasury said the U.S. will default on Nov. 9 if Congress does n't act by then .
# ::snt Clark J. Vitulli was named senior vice president and general manager of this U.S. sales and marketing arm of Japanese auto maker Mazda Motor Corp .

# ::snt He had been a sales and marketing executive with Chrysler for 20 years .
# ::snt When it 's time for their biannual powwow , the nation 's manufacturing titans typically jet off to the sunny confines of resort towns like Boca Raton and Hot Springs .
# ::snt Not this year .
# ::snt The National Association of Manufacturers settled on the Hoosier capital of Indianapolis for its fall board meeting .
# ::snt And the city decided to treat its guests more like royalty or rock stars than factory owners .
# ::snt The idea , of course : to prove to 125 corporate decision makers that the buckle on the Rust Belt is n't so rusty after all , that it 's a good place for a company to expand .
# ::snt On the receiving end of the message were officials from giants like Du Pont and Maytag , along with lesser knowns like Trojan Steel and the Valley Queen Cheese Factory .
# ::snt For starters , the executives joined Mayor William H. Hudnut III for an evening of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and a guest pianist - comedian Victor Borge .
# ::snt Champagne and dessert followed .
# ::snt The next morning , with a police escort , busloads of executives and their wives raced to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway , unimpeded by traffic or red lights .
# ::snt The governor could n't make it , so the lieutenant governor welcomed the special guests .
# ::snt A buffet breakfast was held in the museum , where food and drinks are banned to everyday visitors .
# ::snt Then , in the guests ' honor , the speedway hauled out four drivers , crews and even the official Indianapolis 500 announcer for a 10 - lap exhibition race .
# ::snt After the race , Fortune 500 executives drooled like schoolboys over the cars and drivers .
# ::snt No dummies , the drivers pointed out they still had space on their machines for another sponsor 's name or two .
# ::snt Back downtown , the execs squeezed in a few meetings at the hotel before boarding the buses again .
# ::snt This time , it was for dinner and dancing -- a block away .
# ::snt Under the stars and moons of the renovated Indiana Roof ballroom , nine of the hottest chefs in town fed them Indiana duckling mousseline , lobster consomme , veal mignon and chocolate terrine with a raspberry sauce .
# ::snt Knowing a tasty -- and free -- meal when they eat one , the executives gave the chefs a standing ovation .
# ::snt More than a few CEOs say the red - carpet treatment tempts them to return to a heartland city for future meetings .
# ::snt But for now , they 're looking forward to their winter meeting -- Boca in February .
# ::snt South Korea registered a trade deficit of $ 101 million in October , reflecting the country 's economic sluggishness , according to government figures released Wednesday .
# ::snt Preliminary tallies by the Trade and Industry Ministry showed another trade deficit in October , the fifth monthly setback this year , casting a cloud on South Korea 's export - oriented economy .
# ::snt Exports in October stood at $ 5.29 billion , a mere 0.7 % increase from a year earlier , while imports increased sharply to $ 5.39 billion , up 20 % from last October .
# ::snt South Korea 's economic boom , which began in 1986 , stopped this year because of prolonged labor disputes , trade conflicts and sluggish exports .
# ::snt Government officials said exports at the end of the year would remain under a government target of $ 68 billion .
# ::snt Despite the gloomy forecast , South Korea has recorded a trade surplus of $ 71 million so far this year .
# ::snt From January to October , the nation 's accumulated exports increased 4 % from the same period last year to $ 50.45 billion .
# ::snt Imports were at $ 50.38 billion , up 19 % .
# ::snt Newsweek , trying to keep pace with rival Time magazine , announced new advertising rates for 1990 and said it will introduce a new incentive plan for advertisers .
# ::snt The new ad plan from Newsweek , a unit of the Washington Post Co. , is the second incentive plan the magazine has offered advertisers in three years .
# ::snt Plans that give advertisers discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between Newsweek , Time Warner Inc. 's Time magazine , and Mortimer B. Zuckerman 's U.S. News & World Report .
# ::snt Alan Spoon , recently named Newsweek president , said Newsweek 's ad rates would increase 5 % in January .
# ::snt A full , four - color page in Newsweek will cost $ 100,980 .
